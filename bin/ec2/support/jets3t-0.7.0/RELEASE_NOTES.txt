-------------
Version 0.7.0
-------------

COCKPIT
- Added ability to view and manage Amazon CloudFront distributions using
  a dialog box.
- Added support for configuring Requester Pays buckets.
- Improved support for DevPay credentials, which can now be set and saved 
  directly in the login dialog box instead of only in a properties file.
- User preferences can now be remembered on your computer, so they do not need
  to be re-set every time you start Cockpit.
- Improved dialog box for generating Signed URLs. URLs for multiple objects
  can now be generated at once.

SYNCHRONIZE
- AWS credentials and the cryptographic password can now be provided via prompts
  on the command-line, rather than merely through a properties file.
- Added the --credentials option, which allows AWS credentials to be loaded from 
  an encrypted file rather than an insecure properties file. The encrypted file 
  can be created with the AWSCredentials API or the Cockpit application.
- Synchronize will act as an anonymous client if empty values are provided
  as the AWS access and secret keys. When the S3 connection is anonymous, only 
  public buckets will be accessible.
- Fixed a bug that prevented Synchronize from recognizing duplicate file names
  when uploading to an S3 subdirectory path when using the --batch option.  
- Synchronize will now prompt for HTTP Proxy login credentials if required. If
  proxy credentials are pre-specified in the jets3t.properties file, you should
  not be prompted.
- Improved handling of uploads of many files where the files must first be 
  transformed (compressed or encrypted). In this case, files are now transformed
  and uploaded in batches, where the batch size is set by the 
  synchronize.properties setting 'upload.transformed-files-batch-size'
  

TOOLKIT

  * General

- Added initial implementation of CloudFront service.
- Added property "cloudfront-service.internal-error-retry-max" for defining the
  retry limit for CloudFront internal service errors.
- Added support for configuring and accessing Requester Pays buckets.
- Added property "httpclient.requester-pays-buckets-enabled" for defining whether
  the RestS3Service supports Requester Pays buckets by default.
- Improved support for accessing S3 using DevPay credentials with a new
  credentials class for defining and storing these credentials: 
  AWSDevPayCredentials
- Added a class (AWSDevPayProduct) to represent a DevPay product, and to load 
  information about pre-defined products from the properties file 
  devpay_products.properties.
- Improved the interpretation of .jets3t-ignore files so that child paths or
  arbitrary paths can be specified and ignored. For example, to ignore all CVS
  directories you can now add a single ignore path at the top level: **/CVS

  * REST Implementation

- Added support for proxy authentication settings in jets3t.properties:
  "proxy-user", "proxy-password", and "proxy-domain"
- The service's HTTP proxy settings can be updated an reapplied on-demand using
  a range of #initHttpProxy methods.
- Added property settings to allow the default HTTP and HTTPS ports to be 
  changed, which can be handy when running the service through a proxy for 
  testing: s3service.s3-endpoint-http-port, s3service.s3-endpoint-https-port
- The HttpConnectionManager and HttpClient objects used by the REST service can
  now be reinitialised on-demand using the #initHttpConnection method.
- The underlying HttpClient and HttpConnectionManager objects can be accessed 
  to provide greater control and flexibility after a service is created.
- The automatic time adjustment performed in response to RequestTimeTooSkewed
  errors will now work through proxies.

KUDOS TO:

David Kavanagh for sample code that helped improve HTTP proxy support and 
configurability.

Nikolas Coukouma of Zmanda Inc. for patches to significantly improve support
for Amazon DevPay in the library and Cockpit applications.

Allan Frank for a patch that helped improved the Synchronize application's
handling of uploads.

-------------
Version 0.6.1
-------------

COCKPIT
- Added support for copying or moving objects within and between buckets.
- Added dialog to assist in moving/renaming multiple objects within a bucket.
- Added support for updating objects with new metadata values.
- Fixed issue where downloading items to a directory containing many files and 
  directories (eg 250K+) would cause Cockpit to fail with OutOfMemory errors.
- Added a Confirm Password field to the encryption settings, to help prevent 
  problems where a password is mistyped.
- Cockpit can now generate valid signed GET URLs for DevPay S3 accounts.
    

SYNCHRONIZE
- Synchonize now recognizes when you have specified a partial S3 path when 
  synchronizing DOWN. A partial path is one that does not exactly match a
  directory path. Partial paths can now act as a prefix test that identifies
  objects in an S3 path, where only the objects in S3 that match the prefix are
  downloaded. For example, in a bucket that has a Docs subdirectory containing
  objects named with a timestamp prefix, the S3 path "my-bucket/Docs/2008" will 
  identify the objects in the Docs subdirectory with names beginning with 2008.
- Added --batch option that causes Synchronize to compare and download/upload 
  files in batches of 1000, rather than all at once. This option will reduce the 
  memory required to synchronize buckets with many objects, and will allow file
  transfers to commence as soon as possible rather than after the slow
  comparison process.
- Added --skipmetadata option that causes Synchronize to skip the retrieval of 
  object metadata information from S3. This makes synchs much faster for large 
  buckets, but leave the app with less info to make decisions.
- Added --reportlevel option that allows the user to control how much report
  detail is printed, from 0 (no reporting) to 3 (all reporting).
- Added --move option that deletes local files after they have been uploaded to
  S3, or deletes objects from S3 after they have been downloaded.
- Property settings in the synchronize.properties file, or in the file referred
  to by the --properties option, will override properties of the same name in
  jets3t.properties. This makes it easy to create task-specific properties
  files.


TOOLKIT

  * General

- Added support for the new Copy Object functionality that allows you to copy,
  move, rename and update objects in your S3 account. These operations are
  available through the S3Service as the methods copyObject, moveObject,
  renameObject and updateObjectMetadata.
- Added support for conditional copying of objects, based on ETag and 
  Modified Date comparisons.
- Made it easier to verify that your data is correctly stored in S3 without 
  corruption during transit, by calculating Content-MD5 hash values by default
  in commonly-used S3Object constructors and providing S3Object#verifyData 
  methods that make it easy to verify data downloaded from S3.  
- Added basic support for accessing DevPay S3 accounts. DevPay user and product
  tokens can be provided to the S3Service class directly using the 
  #setDevPayUserToken and #setDevPayProductToken methods, and default token
  values can be specified in the jets3t.properties file using the settings
  "devpay.user-token" and "devpay.product-token".
- Modified Bucket Logging Status changing behaviour to update ACL settings of
  the target bucket before (re)directing log files to the bucket.
- Fixed bug in RestS3Service that caused failures in some circumstances when 
  buckets were created with the "US" location.
- S3Service instances can now be configured individually by providing a
  JetS3tProperties object when constructing the service. The property values
  in this object can also be updated programmatically after the object has
  been constructed.
- FileComparer now supports an optional setting that makes it assume local files 
  are the latest version when there is a clash between the modification dates 
  and hash values of a local file and an object stored in S3. This option should
  only be used as a work-around for users who synchronize Microsoft Excel files
  to S3, as these are the only documents that exhibit the mismatch. To enable
  the option, set the jets3t.properties item 
  "filecomparer.assume-local-latest-in-mismatch" to true.
- Added support to FileComparer for listing objects based on prefix "partitions"
  that allow a bucket to be listed by multiple simultaneous threads. This can
  speed up listings for large buckets containing many virtual subdirectories.
  To use multiple partitions when building S3 object maps, configure the
  jets3t.properties item "filecomparer.bucket-listing.<bucketname>" to specify
  a delimiter string and a traversal depth value separated by a comma, eg:
  filecomparer.bucket-listing.my-bucket=/,2
  to partition the bucket my-bucket based on the '/' delimiter to a depth of
  2 virtual subdirectories.


  * REST Implementation

- Added support for the new Copy Object functionality, and conditional copying.
- The XML parsing code now copes better when object names contain a carriage 
  return character. A work-around is applied to prevent the Java XML parser
  from misinterpreting these characters, a fault which could cause some objects
  to become un-deletable. This new feature is enabled by default, but can be
  disabled with the jets3t.properties setting "xmlparser.sanitize-listings".
- Changed default AuthenticationPreemptive setting for HttpClient connections 
  from true to false, to improve compatibility with NTLM proxies. Preemptive
  auth can be turned on by setting "httpclient.authentication-preemptive" to 
  true in jets3t.properties.
- Refactored repeatable input streams implementations to recognize and support
  standard InputStream objects that can be reset. Thanks to Keith Bonawitz for
  the idea and patch for this.


  * Multi-threaded Service

- Added a new listObjects method that performs a multi-threaded listing of a
  bucket's contents. You provide an array of prefix strings which serve to 
  divide your objects into a number of "partitions", and the service performs
  these prefix-based listings in parallel. See 
  src/org/jets3t/samples/ThreadedObjectListing.java for example usage.
- Added a new notification event ServiceEvent#EVENT_IGNORED_ERRORS that provides
  information about exceptions that were ignored during a multi-threaded S3 
  operation. Exceptions are only ignored if the JetS3t property
  "s3service.ignore-exceptions-in-multi" is set to true.

KUDOS TO:

Shlomo Swidler for numerous improvements to the project's technical 
documentation and code.

Keith Bonawitz for a patch to improve the handling of data re-transmissions 
using reset-able input streams.


-------------
Version 0.6.0
-------------

COCKPIT

- Added support for buckets located in Europe (EU location)
- Generate signed GET URLs based on virtual host names.
- Encryption algorithm can be changed in the preferences dialog.
- Progress dialogs modified to fix display problems with JDK version 6.
- Fixed bug causing encrypted files not to be automatically recognized
  and decrypted in some cases

SYNCHRONIZE

- Added --properties option that allows an explicit properties filename to
  be specified on the command line.
- Added --nodelete option that keeps items on the destination that have been
  removed from the source. This is similar to --keepfiles except that files
  may still be reverted with the --nodelete option.
- Added --noprogress option that prevents progress messages from being 
  printed to the console, for cases where these messages pollute log files.
  This option is similar to --quiet, except the action report is printed.
- Added the --acl option that allows Access Control List settings to be applied
  on the command line. Value must be one of: PRIVATE, PUBLIC_READ, 
  PUBLIC_READ_WRITE
- Added property setting to ignore missing source directories when uploading.
- Progress status messages shortened to fit into 80 character width consoles.


UPLOADER

- Improved skinning capabilities.


COCKPIT LITE

- New Gatekeeper-compatible client application that allows almost all S3 
  operations to be performed by a client via Gatekeeper-provided 
  signed URLs.
  
  
GATEKEEPER

- Extended interfaces and default implementations to provide URL signing
  for all operations performed by the new Cockpit Lite application.
- Improved support for web proxies.
  

TOOLKIT

  * General

- S3Service class can now generate POST forms to allow web browsers to upload
  files or data directly to S3.
- Added support for buckets located in the EU. Due to this change, the 
  "s3service.end-point-host" property is now obsolete.
- Added a default bucket location configuration setting in 
  jets3t.properties: "s3service.default-bucket-location". If you do not
  use an explicit bucket location when you use the bucket creation API
  method, the bucket will be created in this default location.
- Fixed bugs that caused uploads greater than 2GB to fail 
  (Expect: 100-Continue is now supported)
- Added the Bouncy Castle security provider to the suite, increasing the number
  of cipher algorithms available for encrypting files.
- The method S3Service.listObjectsChunked now includes Common Prefixes in the
  result object returned.
- Corrected the metadata name for the original date object metadata item, which
  was originally mis-typed as "jets3t-original-file-date-iso860". This name is
  now "jets3t-original-file-date-iso8601" (added "1" to the end). JetS3t
  tools remain compatible with the original metadata name.
- The FileComparer class used by JetS3t applications can now be configured to
  use pre-generated <filename>.md5 files as a source for MD5 hash values, 
  removing the need for hash values to be calculated for every synchronization 
  operation - and potentially saving a great deal of time when you are 
  synchronizing large files whose content changes rarely. This feature is
  controlled by a group of propery settings in jets3t.properties: 
  filecomparer.use-md5-files, filecomparer.generate-md5-files, 
  filecomparer.skip-upload-of-md5-files.
- File listings as built using the FileComparer.buildFileMap() methods can be
  set not to include place-holder objects to represent empty directories 
  (mimetype "application/x-directory") with the new configuration setting
  uploads.storeEmptyDirectories.

  * REST S3 Service

- Added support for configuring TCP window sizes. In jets3t.properties, the
  settings httpclient.socket-receive-buffer and httpclient.socket-send-buffer 
  are applied to the Socket send and receive buffers used by the underlying
  HttpClient library.
- The REST implementation can now automatically cope with RequestTimeTooSkewed
  errors caused by the client computer's clock disagreeing with S3 about the
  current time. If this happens, JetS3t will look up the time according to S3
  and compensate for the difference between the S3 clock and the client's clock.
- Rudimentary upload bandwidth throttling using the jets3t.properties setting
  httpclient.read-throttle, which is specified in KB/s.
- Proxy settings are now configurable via the jets3t.properties settings:
  httpclient.proxy-autodetect, httpclient.proxy-host, httpclient.proxy-port
- Upgraded HTTPClient library to version 3.1

  * Multi-threaded Service
  
- Administration actions can have more threads assigned than upload/download 
  actions with the new configuration setting s3service.admin-max-thread-count.
  These connections run much faster with more threads and as they are light 
  weight they less likely to fail with higher thread counts.
- Fixed S3ServiceSimpleMulti class to work with download sets larger than the
  number of available HTTP connections. Objects' data is now cached in temp
  files automatically.
- The S3ServiceMulti@downloadObjects methods will restore the original last 
  modified date of downloaded objects if the downloads.restoreLastModifiedDate
  configuration property is set to true. As these methods are used by the JetS3t
  applications, setting this property to true will allow file dates to be 
  retained across synchronizations performed by Cockpit and Synchronize. 
  The original last modified date must be available in the object's metadata
  item named "jets3t-original-file-date-iso8601".

Version 0.5.0
-------------

COCKPIT

- Login credentials can now be stored in S3.
- Added a dialog for configuring Bucket Logging.
- Objects can be filtered by prefix and/or delimiter strings.
- Third-party buckets can be added without first logging in.
- User can cancel the listing of objects in large buckets.
- Files being sent to s3 are only opened when necessary, removing the potential
  for too many files to be open at once (exceeding an Operating System 
  imposed limit).
- When uploading files, specific file/directory paths can be ignored 
  using .jets3t-ignore settings files.
- Access Control List permissions of uploaded files can be set to PRIVATE, 
  PUBLIC_READ or PUBLIC_READ_WRITE


SYNCHRONIZE

- Progress status messages are displayed for long-running processes.
- Files being sent to s3 are only opened when necessary, removing the potential
  for too many files to be open at once (exceeding an Operating System 
  imposed limit).
- When uploading files, specific file/directory paths can be ignored 
  using .jets3t-ignore settings files.
- Access Control List permissions of uploaded files can be set to PRIVATE, 
  PUBLIC_READ or PUBLIC_READ_WRITE


UPLOADER

A new applet/application to allow third parties without AWS accounts or 
credentials to upload files to an S3 account. The Uploader provides a simple 
wizard-based GUI allowing end-users to provide information, choose the 
file(s) they will upload, and see upload progress.

The Uploader is highly configurable via the uploader.properties file, with 
settings to configure: user input fields, explanatory text messages, 
names/images/tooltips for buttons at each stage in the wizard, basic skinning 
of the Uploader (an example HTML-like skin is included), and branding.

The Uploader is designed to work closely with a Gatekeeper server, which 
provides the Uploader with signed URLs to allow it to perform uploads.


GATEKEEPER

A new servlet that acts as a Gatekeeper server for S3 operations. The servlet
receives requests for S3 operations (GET, HEAD, PUT, DELETE) and responds to 
these requests with either a signed URL allowing the operation, or a message 
stating that the operation will not be allowed.

Basic decision-making functionality is included with the Gatekeeper Servlet, 
however it is straight-forward to obtain more advanced control over the 
Gatekeeper's behaviour by implementing the relevant Java interfaces. There 
are specific interfaces for: allowing/denying requests, signing URLs, and 
assigning unique transaction IDs for a request.

The Gatekeeper is designed to work closely with the Uploader application, 
providing it with signed URLs so the Uploader can add items to an S3 account 
without the end-user having any access to the AWS account credentials.


TOOLKIT

  * General

- Properties for many aspects of jets3t behaviour can be set by the 
  user in a properties file.
- Support for getting/setting Server Access Logging for buckets.
- Improved encryption mechanism, which now uses PBE-based encryption and 
  allows users to set their preferred algorithm. 
  NOTE: All changes *should* be backwards compatible, but due to these 
  changes there may be an increased risk of data loss for encrypted items.
- New methods to chunk bucket listings, allowing for better handling of 
  buckets with many objects.
- A limit to the maximum number of simultaneous communication threads 
  (ie those interacting with S3) is now imposed. This limit can be set in 
  the properties file, and defaults to 50.
- Signed URLs can be generated for GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE requests
- Fixed bug where object keys/names with special characters were not 
  correctly encoded.
- DNS caching is limited to 300 seconds.
- When an object's data comes from a file, the file can be opened only when 
  necessary rather than being opened as soon as the object is created.
- Added documentation for advanced options settings and logging
  
  * REST/HTTP implementation
  
- Requests that fail due to S3 Internal Server error are retried a 
  configurable number of times, with an increasing delay between each 
  retry attempt.
- The REST/HTTP implementation is now less fussy about object key names, 
  and will allow unusual names such as full URL strings etc.
- Can detect (in some circumstances) a browser's proxy settings when run 
  inside an applet context, and allows for callbacks to a credentials 
  provider object when authentication is required (eg for proxies 
  requiring username/password)
- Signed URLs can be used to perform GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE operations 
  without the need for knowledge of AWS credentials.
- Added a utility method putObjectWithSignedUrl to upload objects to S3 
  using only a signed PUT URL (ie no AWS credentials are required).
- Configurable user agent string.
- Sends an upload object's MD5 data hash to S3 in the header Content-MD5, 
  to confirm no data corruption has taken place on the wire.

  * SOAP implementation

- Tests for data corruption on the wire by matching ETag returned by S3 with 
  expected MD5 hash value.

  * Multi-threaded Service

- Signed URLs can be used to perform GET, HEAD, PUT and DELETE operations of 
  multiple items at a time, without the need for knowledge of AWS credentials.


KNOWN ISSUES

  * General
  
- Uploading or downloading multiple large files can result in connection 
  errors if the network connection is flooded. The chances of such errors 
  can be reduced by using low values (eg 2) for for the jets3t.properties 
  settings s3service.max-thread-count and httpclient.max-connections.
  
  * Cockpit
  
- Copy & paste and Drag & drop doesn't work on some versions of Linux, 
  making it difficult to enter AWS credentials.
